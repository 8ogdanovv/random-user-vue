## Overview

Random User Generator is a straightforward Vue.js application designed to showcase the use of the Fetch API to retrieve random user data from the [RandomUser.me](https://randomuser.me) API. The project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for fetching and displaying random user profiles.

## Project Structure

The project structure is minimal, with the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the web page.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the web page.
- `app.js`: The JavaScript file that defines the Vue.js application.

## HTML

The HTML structure is straightforward, consisting of a `div` with the id "app" where Vue.js binds and displays the user data. It includes an image, user information (name and email), and a button to fetch a random user.

## CSS

The CSS styles the page, ensuring a visually appealing layout. It provides consistent typography, centers the content, and adds styling to the user's profile image based on their gender.

## JavaScript

The JavaScript file initializes a Vue.js application, fetches random user data from the API, and updates the user interface with the retrieved information when the "Get Random User" button is clicked.
